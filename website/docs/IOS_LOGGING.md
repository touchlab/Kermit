# iOS Logging

There are three `LogWriter` implementations for iOS.

## XcodeSeverityWriter

This is the default `LogWriter`. It is designed for local development. Each severity is represented with an emoji. `Throwable` instances sent to this writer will be written with `println` rather than oslog because oslog trims long strings.

## OSLogWriter

This is the parent class of `XcodeSeverityWriter`. There is no emoji added for severity, and `Throwable` is sent as a string to OSLog. This may trim exceptions. You can implement a custom version that writes each line of a stack trace to OSLog, or whatever else you'd like to do. Override `logThrowable`.

In addition to the `MessageStringFormatter`, `OSLogWriter` takes in three optional parameters specific to OSLog calls:
* `subsystem` - An identifier string that's passed directly into the OSLog constructor. (See more [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/oslog/2320726-init)).
* `category` - A category within the subsystem that's passed directly into the OSLog constructor. (See more [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/oslog/2320726-init)).
* `publicLogging` - When true `OSLog` enforces logs to be public (See documentation [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging/generating_log_messages_from_your_code#3665948)). 

## NSLogWriter

Legacy implementation using `NSLog`.
