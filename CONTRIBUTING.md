# Contributing to a Touchlab Project

## License
By contributing you agree for your contribution to be licensed under the same license as the project which can be found in the LICENSE file.
If no LICENSE file is present, all intellectual property rights for the project and contributions to the project are reserved by Touchlab.

## Opening an issue
Issues can be useful for reporting bugs and requesting features.
If you simply have a question about the project or how to use it, please instead reach out in the [Kotlinlang touchlab-tools channel](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/CTJB58X7X)

### Reporting a Bug
When reporting a problem with the project please provide as much detail as possible including:
- The version of the project used as well as other relevant versions (eg: Kotlin, Android, iOS)
- What behavior was expected
- Steps to reproduce

#### Sample Project
Sharing a simple sample project which reproduces the issue is **immensely** helpful.
Issues are often caused by project specific configurations and uses which are not practical for us to derive from a bug report.
A reproducing project is often the first thing we ask for on difficult bugs and going through the process will help you make a more informed bug report.

### Requesting an Enhancement
We get a lot of great feedback from the community about how they use our projects and what can make them better.
If you'd like to suggest an improvement that is not fixing a defect, please label it as an Enhancement.
Share as much info as you can about your use case and how you would expect the enhancement might work.
Please understand that even great ideas might not fit in with our vision for the project and, even if we don't implement them, we greatly appreciate your input

## Submitting a PR
We appreciate community members who are excited for our projects and willing to help improve them!

### Before Submitting a PR
If you are considering making a significant change, **please get in contact with us** before commiting a significant amount of time and effort.
Even well thought out and constructed PRs sometimes do not fit into the current goals of the project and we would hate for anyone to feel their time is wasted.
To discuss changes you can first [submit an issue](#opening-an-issue) documenting the bug or enhancement. Alternatively you can reach out in the [Kotlinlang touchlab-tools channel](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/CTJB58X7X)

### When Submitting a PR
Please be sure to check that no tests are broken and relevant tests have been added.
Include documentation updates for any changes to behavior or usage.
Be as detailed as possible in your PR comments about what has changed and how to test it.
